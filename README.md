Rock Paper Scissors in Javascript 


## Project Description 

Create a game of Rock Paper Scissors with a UI using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Overview 

This project started off using only console.log() to play, before using the images to click on. Overall, I had fun making it and really like the final product. Compared to my landing page, I used sections and avoid divs excepts for styling purposes. I practiced making changes to the DOM, logic, as well as my CSS skills.
